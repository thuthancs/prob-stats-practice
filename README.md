# Probability Statistics Problems

My attempted solutions to probability & statistics problems when I have some free time :) I organize each problem doc with my initial reasoning, and if it's correct, I will state that. If it's not, I will add another section called "Correction". I want to have a space for active learning and revision where I can record my mistakes/what I forget, along with valuable resources that aid in correcting my mistakes. I make an intentional decision not to use AI here because this is more of an honest, personal catalogue of practicing problem-solving rather than a product that has any users, where I am under pressure to ship something fast.
